# Tailscale Derper Docker Image

This repository contains the Dockerfile and necessary scripts to build a Docker image for Tailscale's Derper. Derper is a standalone DERP server for Tailscale networks. This custom Docker image includes health checks and metadata for easy integration into your infrastructure.

## Features

- **Health Checks**: Included health checks on ports 443 and 3478 ensure the service is running smoothly.
- **OCI Compatible**: The image is tagged with OCI-compatible labels for better integration with container orchestration tools.
- **Custom Startup Script**: Simplifies the process of configuring and starting the Derper server.

## Getting Started

To use this Docker image, you can pull it from the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) using the following command:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/zfouts/container-tailscale-derp:latest
```


## Usage

After pulling the image, you can run it using Docker with a command like the following:

```
docker run -d --name derper -p 443:443 -p 3478:3478  ghcr.io/zfouts/container-tailscale-derp:latest "-hostname derper.example.com"
```

This will start a Derper server instance running in the background.

### Docker Compose

Alternatively you can use docker compose:

```
services:
  derper:
    image: ghcr.io/zfouts/container-tailscale-derp:latest
    container_name: derper
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "3478:3478"
    volumes:
      - /data/tailscale/etc:/opt/tailscale/etc
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: ["-hostname", "derper.example.com"]
```
